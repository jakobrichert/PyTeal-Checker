A web app for the developer tooling bounty during the schelling point hackathon https://gitcoin.co/issue/algorandfoundation/grow-algorand/132/100027512
You can access the website here https://jakobr21.eu.pythonanywhere.com/


Uses a machine learning model to determine validity of PyTeal smart contract. 

# Current State

It uses a very simple machine learning model as well as a small set of data. (hopefully this data will be expanded on in the future once PyTeal and algorand become more popular)
This is a very simple web app at the moment

# Future of this project

In the future this project could be used as a web app to give information about best practices when writing smart contracts in PyTeal. This web app could be expanded
to use other methods such as parsing to determine if and where the smart contract is insecure. It could also use parsing to pinpoint where a contract may be at risk in the future 

I also thought it may be possible to expand on this and create  DAO that will work together to determine best security practices and help companies audit smart contracts

#### WARNING DO NOT USE THIS AS A PRODUCTION TYPE SOFTWARE TO DETERMINE IF YOUR SMART CONTRACT IS SECURE ####
PyTeal Checker does not take any liability for your smart contract
